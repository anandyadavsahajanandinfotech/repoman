    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Sightinfusion infotech's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you through our app, Photo Collage - Pic Grid Maker.</p>
    <p>We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.</p>
    <p>We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.</p>
    <p>We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law.</p>
    <p>Our app may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.</p>
    <p>You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.</p>
    <p>Your continued use of our app will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.</p>

    <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
    <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app.</p>
    <p>You are not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Sightinfusion infotech.</p>
    <p>Sightinfusion infotech is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
    <p>The Photo Collage - Pic Grid Maker app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Photo Collage - Pic Grid Maker app won’t work properly or at all.</p>
    <p>The app does use third-party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.</p>
    <p>Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Google Play Services</a></li>
        <!-- Add more links if necessary -->
    </ul>
    <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Sightinfusion infotech will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Sightinfusion infotech cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
    <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
    <p>Along the same lines, Sightinfusion infotech cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Sightinfusion infotech cannot accept responsibility.</p>
    <p>With respect to Sightinfusion infotech’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Sightinfusion infotech accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
    <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Sightinfusion infotech does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
    <p>Changes to This Terms and Conditions: We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
    <p>Contact Us: If you have any questions or suggestions about our Terms and Conditions, do not hesitate to contact us at info@sightinfusion.com.</p>
